# demo-formula

This is a demo formula that installs apache. I'm using it to teach an intro to saltstack class.

Just about everything should be handled by the defaults.yaml and map.jinja.



Install and setup brew:
```
ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

```
brew install cask
brew cask install vagrant
```

```
cd <formula dir>
bundle install
```
or
```
sudo gem install test-kitchen
sudo gem install kitchen-vagrant
sudo gem install kitchen-salt
```

Run a converge on the default configuration:
```
kitchen converge default
```
